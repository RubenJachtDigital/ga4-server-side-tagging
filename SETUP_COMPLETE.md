```

## 🧪 Test Coverage

### Your Original Endpoint Tests
I've moved and enhanced your comprehensive endpoint tests to `tests/integration/EndpointTest.php` with:

- ✅ **Cloudflare Worker transmission** testing
- ✅ **Direct GA4 transmission** testing  
- ✅ **Event batching** functionality
- ✅ **Bot detection** testing
- ✅ **Rate limiting** testing
- ✅ **Consent handling** testing
- ✅ **Encryption support** testing
- ✅ **Error handling** testing
- ✅ **Queue processing** testing
- ✅ **Header filtering** testing

### New Unit Tests Added
- `EncryptionUtilTest.php` - Tests encryption/decryption with mocking
- `EventLoggerTest.php` - Tests database operations with mocks

## 🔧 Real Payload Testing

The tests use your exact payload structures:

### JavaScript Client (Single Event)
```json
{
  "event": {
    "name": "custom_user_engagement",
    "params": {
      "engagement_time_msec": 60000,
      "client_id": "2046349794.1753702447"
    }
  },
  "consent": {
    "ad_user_data": "GRANTED",
    "ad_personalization": "GRANTED"
  }
}
```

### Cloudflare Worker (Batch)
```json
{
  "events": [/* multiple events with headers */],
  "batch": true
}
```

### Direct GA4 Format
```json
{
  "client_id": "1406931247.1753690598",
  "events": [{"name": "page_view", "params": {...}}],
  "consent": {"ad_user_data": "GRANTED"},
  "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
  "ip_override": "37.17.209.130"
}
```

## ✅ Status Check

I've successfully completed the setup:

1. ✅ **Composer dependencies installed** (55 packages)
2. ✅ **PHP syntax validated** across all files
3. ✅ **Test structure organized** (unit + integration)
4. ✅ **Code quality tools configured**
5. ✅ **CI/CD pipeline created**
6. ✅ **Documentation written**

## 🚀 Quick Start

Your testing environment is ready! You can now:

```bash
# Test your transmission methods
composer test:integration

# Check code quality
composer cs:check
composer stan

# Set up for CI/CD
